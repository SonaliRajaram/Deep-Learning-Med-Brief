artificial intelligence-powered chatbot in clinical vignettes.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This is an observational study of the performance of 
an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot tasked with solving unknown 
neurologic case vignettes. The primary objective of the study is to assess the 
current capabilities of widely-accessible artificial intelligence within the 
field of clinical neurology in order to determine how this technology can be 
deployed in clinical practice, and what insights can be learned from its 
performance and translated to clinical education.
METHODS: This observational study tested the accuracy of GPT-4, an artificial 
intelligence-powered chatbot, at appropriately localizing and generating a 
differential diagnosis for a series of 29 clinical case vignettes. The cases 
were from previously published educational material prepared for learners. No 
cases required more than text input, a current limitation of GPT-4. The primary 
outcome measures were ranked accuracy of localization and differential diagnosis 
based on clinical history and exam alone and after ancillary clinical data was 
provided. Secondary outcome measures included a comparison of accuracy by case 
difficulty.
RESULTS: GPT-4 identified the correct localization less than 50% of the time and 
performed worse when provided ancillary testing. GPT-4 was more accurate with 
localization and diagnosis of easier versus harder cases. Diagnostic accuracy 
was independent of its ability to localize the lesion.
DISCUSSION: GPT-4 did not perform as well on neurology clinical vignettes as 
compared to reported accuracy when provided other medical clinical vignettes. 
Incorporation of an AI chatbot into the practice of clinical neurology will 
require neurology-focused teaching.","Study tested the accuracy of GPT-4, an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot.

37740904,"Natural language processing in narrative breast radiology reporting in 
University Malaya Medical Centre.","Radiology reporting is narrative, and its content depends on the clinician's 
ability to interpret the images accurately. A tertiary hospital, such as 
anonymous institute, focuses on writing reports narratively as part of training 
for medical personnel. Nevertheless, free-text reports make it inconvenient to 
extract information for clinical audits and data mining. Therefore, we aim to 
convert unstructured breast radiology reports into structured formats using 
natural language processing (NLP) algorithm. This study used 327 de-identified 
breast radiology reports from the anonymous institute. The radiologist 
identified the significant data elements to be extracted. Our NLP algorithm 
achieved 97% and 94.9% accuracy in training and testing data, respectively. 
Henceforth, the structured information was used to build the predictive model 
for predicting the value of the BIRADS category. The model based on random 
forest generated the highest accuracy of 92%. Our study not only fulfilled the 
demands of clinicians by enhancing communication between medical personnel, but 
it also demonstrated the usefulness of mineable structured data in yielding 
significant insights.","Radiology reporting is narrative, and its content depends on the clinician's ability to interpret the images accurately.

transfusion and postoperative wound complications in patients: A meta-analysis.","We examined whether small incision aortic root replacement could reduce the 
amount of blood transfusion during operation and the risk of postoperative 
complications. An extensive e-review of the 4 main databases (PubMed, Cochrane, 
Web of Science and EMBASE) was carried out to determine all the published trials 
by July 2023. The search terms used were associated with partial versus full 
sternotomy and aortic root. This analysis only included the study articles that 
compared partial and full sternotomy. After excluding articles based on titles 
or abstracts, selected full-text articles had reference lists searched for any 
potential further articles. We analysed a total of 2167 subjects from 10 
comparable trials. The minimally invasive aortic root graft in breastbone 
decreased the duration of hospitalization (MD, -2.58; 95% CI, -3.15, -2.01, 
p < 0.0001) and intraoperative red blood cell transfusion (MD, -1.27; 95% CI, 
-2.34, -0.19, p = 0.02). However, there were no significant differences in wound 
infection (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.16, 4.93, p = 0.88), re-exploration for bleeding 
(OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.60, 1.53, p = 0.86), intraoperative blood loss (MD,

CI, -19.10, 4.32, p = 0.22); the results showed that the microsternotomy did not 
differ significantly from that of the routine approach. Small sternotomy may be 
an effective and safe substitute for the treatment of the aorta root.

studies are required to back up the current limited literature evidence showing 
a benefit in terms of complications like postoperative wound infections or the

37740212,"A network meta-analysis of different acupuncture modalities in the treatment of 
bronchial asthma.","BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids and Beta-2 receptor agonists are commonly used for 
the treatment of asthma in clinical practice, while these agents are accompanied 
by adverse reactions of different kinds. Studies have shown that acupuncture is 
effective in treating bronchial asthma. However, different acupuncture 
modalities have different costs and skill requirements, and there remains a lack 
of comparisons between different acupuncture modalities. This study aims to 
assess the efficacy of various acupuncture modalities in the treatment of 
asthma.
METHODS: The following databases were searched for randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) on acupuncture for the treatment of bronchial asthma from database 
inception to August 26, 2022: PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of 
Science, Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Wanfang Database (Wanfang 
Date), VIP Database (VIP), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM). Stata 15.1 
software was used to conduct network meta-analysis. The risk of bias in the 
included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool 2 
(RoB2).
RESULTS: A total of 8,693 relevant studies were found, and 30 RCTs were 
included, involving 2,722 patients with bronchial asthma and eight acupuncture 
modalities: manual acupuncture, moxibustion, electroacupuncture, ignipuncture, 
flying needle acupuncture, acupoint catgut embedding, acupoint application, and 
warm-needle moxibustion. The other 29 studies had certain risks, with the 
quality graded as ""moderate"". Among the pair-wise comparisons of statistical 
significance (p < 0.05), acupoint application was the most effective in 
improving pulmonary function (FEV1: Traditional medicine therapy-acupoint 
application [-7.29 (-12.11,-2.47)]; acupoint application-moxibustion [7.20 
(0.28,14.11)]; FVC: acupoint application-Traditional medicine therapy [8.02

the ACT score of the patients (Traditional medicine therapy-acupoint catgut 
embedding [-4.29 (-7.94, -0.65)]; acupoint catgut embedding-moxibustion [5.52 
(1.05,9.99)]).
CONCLUSION: Acupoint application has evident merits in improving the clinical 
response rate and pulmonary function, while acupoint catgut embedding can 
improve other secondary indicators. For the clinical treatment of asthma, 
acupoint application can be selected as a complementary and alternative therapy,

compete hurt in Danish youth elite athletes.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between analgesic use and willingness to 
compete hurt (WCH) in Danish youth elite athletes, and to explore factors 
associated with such willingness.
DESIGN: 4-week prospective cohort study.
METHODS: 592 Danish youth elite athletes (15-20 years) completed a baseline 
questionnaire assessing demographic information, sport history, and WCH, and 
provided weekly reports on analgesic use for 4 weeks via text messages. 
Analgesic use was categorized as no use (0 weeks) or use across 1, 2, 3, or 
4 weeks, and as the total number of days with analgesic use. Multinomial 
logistic regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses 
estimated the association between analgesic use and WCH. Linear backward 
stepwise regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with WCH.
RESULTS: Overall, risk of analgesic use increased significantly with increasing 
WCH scores (relative risk ratios ranging from 1.06 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.12%) to 
1.34% (95% CI 1.15 to 1.57)). The incidence rate of analgesic use increased 
significantly with increasing WCH scores (incidence rate ratio 1.09 (95% CI 1.04 
to 1.14)). Associations between the investigated possible antecedent factors and 
WCH were weak and not considered practically important (R2 = 0.05 or lower).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher WCH scores were associated with increasing risk of analgesic 
use, irrespective of the underlying reason for the use, in Danish youth elite 
athletes, suggesting that analgesics may be an ingrained part of a 
sport-specific culture of risk acceptance. Future studies should include 
measures of culture, norms, and social interaction to better explain the 
variance in WCH.","Analgesic use was categorized as no use (0 weeks) or use across 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks. The incidence rate of analgesic use increased significantly with increasing WCH scores.

hypercholesterolemia: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.","BACKGROUND: The exploration of lipid-lowering resources, such as phytosterols, 
for the complementary nutritional treatment of hypercholesterolemia is relevant 
to reduce cardiovascular risk. The use of phytosterols in capsules or tablets 
can bring advantages in the context of diet therapy, but such format is still 
less studied when compared to fortified foods.
OBJECTIVE: Systematically review randomized clinical trials on the effects of 
phytosterol supplementation, in capsules or tablets, on the lipid profile and 
its use in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in adults.
DESIGN: A systematic review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis, with a PROSPERO 
protocol registered under number CRD42021249539. The process was conducted by 
two independent reviewers. Only randomized clinical trials with phytosterol 
supplementation in adult individuals with hypercholesterolemia were included. 
The terms were searched in the databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane 
Library/CENTRAL, Embase, LILACS and Web of Science, without restriction of time 
and language. The manual search was also performed through the list of 
references of articles included in this review.
RESULTS: The searches resulted in 977 articles. 22 articles were selected, whose 
full text was read, and according to the eligibility criteria 10 were 
incorporated into the review. The studies were separated into groups according 
to the association of the intervention with changes in lifestyle and the 
characteristics extracted from the studies were summarized and displayed in 
tables. Most studies have revealed a positive association between phytosterol 
supplementation and cholesterol reduction, despite the short duration of 
interventions.
CONCLUSION: The analyzed studies showed that phytosterol supplements can be 
useful to modulate the lipid profile, helping to reduce the plasma concentration 
of LDL cholesterol. However, more research with the aforementioned 
supplementation in such pharmaceutical formats should be encouraged.","The use of phytosterols in capsules or tablets can bring advantages in the context of diet therapy, but such format is still less studied when compared to fortified foods.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: An electronic search in PubMed Central's and additional 
electronic databases was performed. The search strategy was limited to human 
studies, full-text English or French articles published from 1990 until april 
2023. The extracted data included defect location, membrane type, biomaterials,

37739056,Prevalence of Awake Bruxism: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence of Awake Bruxism (AB).
SOURCES: The electronic search was done in Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS, 
Livivo, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to January 2nd, 2023. The search 
strategies combined terms such as ""bruxism,"" ""awake,"" and related terms when 
conducting searches in databases. Grey literature was consulted through Google 
Scholar, ProQuest, and OpenGrey.
STUDY SELECTION: Two independent reviewers participated in the study selection 
stages and included observational studies assessing the prevalence of AB, 
detected using reporting feedback (self or family report), clinical examination, 
and/or instrumental methods, regardless of the sex and age of the population.
DATA: Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's 
checklist for prevalence studies. Ratio meta-analyses were performed using R 
Statistics software.
RESULTS: From a total of 3,083 studies identified by the searches on databases, 
322 articles were reviewed the full-text and a total of 81 (quantitative 
synthesis) and 83 (narrative synthesis) studies were included. Only fifteen 
studies reached complete methodological quality. Two overall meta-analyses were 
performed, grouped based on convenience and population-based samples. The 
overall prevalence for possible AB was 32.08% and 16.16%, respectively. For the 
subgroup analyses, the prevalence rate showed a wide variation in different 
studied populations, approximately 14%-32% for women and 19%-30% for men, for 
population-based and convenience studies, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Possible AB prevalence was set from 16% to 32%. Studies with 
probable AB and definitive AB are still necessary.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Studying the prevalence of waking bruxism is of interest 
to both dentists and patients. Knowing the probability of patients having awake 
bruxism allows the dentist to offer comprehensive preventive approaches to 
patients, avoiding deleterious consequences resulting from this condition. The 
present study reveals that the condition of bruxism during wakefulness is 
present in one out of every six adult patients studied. In pediatric patients, 
although this condition seems to be equally present, not enough studies were 
found to support this information for probable and definitive bruxism.","Possible AB prevalence was set from 16% to 32%. Studies with probable AB and definitive AB are still necessary.

quantitatively by fitting random-effects models.
RESULTS: Search of databases on 3 February 2023 yielded 25 studies fitting our 
inclusion criteria. Of those, only two RCT and 17 non-randomized studies 
included a standard prophylaxis comparator group. Furthermore, risk of bias in 
the latter was substantial, primarily due to before-after study designs and

the clinical examination, and the evaluation of comorbid conditions including 
the urinary tract (LUTS), gastrointestinal tract (GIT), pain, and sexual 
function. The physical examination of patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) 
should include a reproducible method of describing and quantifying the degree of 
POP and only the Pelvic Organ Quantification (POP-Q) system or the Simplified 
Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (S-POP) system have enough reproducibility 
to be recommended. POP examination should be done with an empty bladder and 
patients can be supine but should be upright if the prolapse cannot be 
reproduced. No other parameters of the examination aid in describing and 
quantifying POP. Post-void residual urine volume >100 ml is commonly used to 
assess for voiding difficulty. Prolapse reduction can be used to predict the 
possibility of postoperative persistence of voiding difficulty. There is no 
benefit of urodynamic testing for assessment of detrusor overactivity as it does 
not change the management. In women with POP and stress urinary incontinence 
(SUI), the cough stress test should be performed with a bladder volume of at 
least 200 ml and with the prolapse reduced either with a speculum or by a 
pessary. The urodynamic assessment only changes management when SUI and voiding 
dysfunction co-exist. Demonstration of preoperative occult SUI has a positive 
predictive value for de novo SUI of 40% but most useful is its absence, which 
has a negative predictive value of 91%. The routine addition of radiographic or 
physiological testing of the GIT currently has no additional value for a 
physical examination. In subjects with GIT symptoms further radiological but not 
physiological testing appears to aid in diagnosing enteroceles, sigmoidoceles, 
and intussusception, but there are no data on how this affects outcomes. There 
were no articles in the search on the evaluation of the co-morbid conditions of 
pain or sexual dysfunction in women with POP.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical pelvic examination remains the central tool for 
evaluation of POP and a system such as the POP-Q or S-POP should be used to 
describe and quantify. The value of investigation for urinary tract dysfunction 
was discussed and findings presented. The routine addition of GI radiographic or 
physiological testing is currently not recommended. There are no data on the 
role of the routine assessment of pain or sexual function, and this area needs 
more study. Imaging studies alone cannot replace clinical examination for the 
assessment of POP.","The main themes of this manuscript were the clinical examination, and the evaluation of comorbid conditions including urinary tract (LUTS), gastrointestinal tract (GIT), pain, and sexual function.

Gap: A Review.","The opioid epidemic has been an ongoing public health concern in the United 
States (US) for the last few decades. The number of overdose deaths involving 
opioids, hereafter referred to as overdose deaths, has increased yearly since 
the mid-1990s. One treatment modality for opioid use disorder (OUD) is 
medication-assisted treatment (MAT). As of 2022, only three pharmacotherapy 
options have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
treating OUD: buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. Unlike buprenorphine and 
naltrexone, methadone dispensing and administrating are restricted to opioid 
treatment programs (OTPs). To date, Tennessee has no medication units, and 
administration and dispensing of methadone is limited to licensed OTPs. This 
review details the research process used to develop a policy draft for 
medication units in Tennessee. This review is comprised of three parts: (1) a 
rapid review aimed at identifying obstacles and facilitators to OTP access in 
the US, (2) a descriptive analysis of Tennessee's geographic availability of 
OTPs, pharmacies, and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), and (3) policy 
mapping of 21 US states' OTP regulations. In the rapid review, a total of 486 
articles were imported into EndNote from PubMed and Embase. After removing 152 
duplicates, 357 articles were screened based on their title and abstract. Thus, 
34 articles underwent a full-text review to identify articles that addressed the 
accessibility of methadone treatment for OUD. A total of 18 articles were 
identified and analyzed. A descriptive analysis of Tennessee's availability of 
OTP showed that the state has 22 OTPs. All 22 OTPs were matched to a county and 
a region based on their address resulting in 15 counties (16%) and all three 
regions having at least one OTP. A total of 260 FQHCs and 2294 pharmacies are in 
Tennessee. Each facility was matched to a county based on its address resulting 
in 70 counties (74%) having at least one FQHC and 94 counties (99%) having at 
least one pharmacy. As of 31 December 2022, 17 states mentioned medication units

Sclerosis/Frontotemporal Degeneration Spectrum Disorders.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal 
degeneration (FTD) spectrum disorders have a strong genetic component. Genetic 
counselors are a limited resource, and therefore, other providers must be 
prepared to integrate genetic testing into their practice.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent ALS/FTD studies have demonstrated that lack of family 
history does not preclude a genetic etiology. The benefits of a genetic 
diagnosis have expanded to include the potential to treat; thus, genetic testing 
is increasingly recommended to be offered to all persons with ALS/FTD.
SUMMARY: Offering genetic testing to persons with ALS/FTD spectrum disorders 
should be part of routine clinical neurologic care. All genetic testing should 
include discussion about the medical and psychosocial implications of testing 
for the patient and family members. Neurologists should be prepared to 
facilitate this process and recognize when referral to a genetic counselor is 
indicated.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) spectrum disorders have a strong genetic component.

amputation due to vascular aetiology indicate a great need for long-lasting 
holistic rehabilitation. An in-depth understanding of the psychosocial problems 
is essential for the guidance of health professionals in meeting and normalising 
patients' experiences and emotions. Furthermore, identifying the psychological 
problems may help develop effective rehabilitation and counselling programmes. 
This meta-aggregation study aims to explore the psychosocial perspectives of 
individuals who have undergone a major lower-limb amputation due to vascular 
aetiology during the post-discharge rehabilitation phase.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic meta-aggregation study will be performed to 
identify full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on patients' 
psychosocial perspectives on major lower-limb amputation due to vascular 
aetiology from post-discharge to several years afterward. The databases Embase, 
CINAHL Ultimate, APA PsycInfo, PubMed and Scopus will be searched with no 
limitations regarding the publication year. Studies that satisfy the eligibility 
criteria will be critically appraised using an acknowledged checklist and 
synthesised using the Joanna Briggs Institute three-phase approach for the 
synthesis of meta-aggregation studies. The GRADE-CERQual (Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation- Confidence in Evidence 
from Reviews of Qualitative research) tool will be used to determine the level 
of confidence in the qualitative evidence, and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) reporting guidelines will be

37734368,"Patient's views of empathic and compassionate healthcare interactions: A scoping 
review.","BACKGROUND: Compassion and empathy are integral to safe and effective patient 
care. However, to date, most studies have focused on exploring, defining, 
measuring and analysing empathy and compassion from the perspective of 
researchers or clinicians. There has been limited attention to the perspectives 
of patients.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to map the literature to 
identify patients' views of healthcare provider behaviours that exemplify 
empathic and compassionate interactions.
METHOD: This review used the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology. 
A comprehensive search of eight electronic databases was conducted with English 
language studies published in the last 10 years considered for inclusion.
RESULTS: Database searching resulted in 459 records for initial screening. After 
de-duplication and conducting a title and abstract review, 32 full-text articles 
were screened for eligibility. A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria 
and were critically reviewed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The 
included papers profiled studies that had been conducted in clinical settings 
across seven countries. The healthcare encounters described in the papers were 
with a range of healthcare providers. Two overarching and interconnected 
categories of behaviours were identified as indicative of empathic/compassionate 
encounters: (1) communication skills such as listening, touch, body language, 
eye contact and positive demeanour; and (2) helping behaviours demonstrated by 
small acts of kindness that go beyond routine healthcare.
CONCLUSION: Given the breadth of studies describing the positive impact of 
empathy/compassion on people's physical and psychosocial wellbeing, the results 
from this review are valuable and shed new light on patients' views and 
experiences. The results provide a deeper understanding of healthcare provider 
behaviours that exemplify empathic and compassionate healthcare interactions and

37732940,"Applied use of biomechanical measurements from human tissues for the development 
of medical skills trainers: a scoping review.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to identify quantitative 
biomechanical measurements of human tissues, the methods for obtaining these 
measurements, and the primary motivations for conducting biomechanical research.
INTRODUCTION: Medical skills trainers are a safe and useful tool for clinicians 
to use when learning or practicing medical procedures. The haptic fidelity of 
these devices is often poor, which may be because the synthetic materials chosen 
for these devices do not have the same mechanical properties as human tissues. 
This review investigates a heterogenous body of literature to identify which 
biomechanical properties are available for human tissues, the methods for 
obtaining these values, and the primary motivations behind conducting 
biomechanical tests.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies containing quantitative measurements of the 
biomechanical properties of human tissues were included. Studies that primarily 
focused on dynamic and fluid mechanical properties were excluded. Additionally, 
studies only containing animal, in silico, or synthetic materials were excluded 
from this review.
METHODS: This scoping review followed the JBI methodology for scoping reviews 
and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 
extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Sources of evidence were extracted 
from CINAHL (EBSCO), IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and engineering 
conference proceedings. The search was limited to the English language. Two 
independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts as well as full-text 
reviews. Any conflicts that arose during screening and full-text review were 
mediated by a third reviewer. Data extraction was conducted by 2 independent 
reviewers and discrepancies were mediated through discussion. The results are 
presented in tabular, figure, and narrative formats.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from a total of 186 full-text publications. All of 
the studies, except for 1, were experimental. Included studies came from 33 
different countries, with the majority of the studies coming from the United 
States. Human tissues samples were ex vivo, and the most commonly studied tissue 
type was musculoskeletal. In this study, nearly 200 unique biomechanical values 
were reported, and the most commonly reported value was Young's (elastic) 
modulus. The most common type of mechanical test performed was tensile testing, 
and the most common reason for testing human tissues was to characterize 
biomechanical properties. Although the number of published studies on 
biomechanical properties of human tissues has increased over the past 20 years, 
there are many gaps in the literature. Of the 186 included studies, only 7 used 
human tissues for the design or validation of medical skills training devices. 
Furthermore, in studies where biomechanical values for human tissues have been 
obtained, a lack of standardization in engineering assumptions, methodologies, 
and tissue preparation may implicate the usefulness of these values.
CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first of its kind to give a broad overview of 
the biomechanics of human tissues in the published literature. With respect to 
high-fidelity haptics, there is a large gap in the published literature. Even in 
instances where biomechanical values are available, comparing or using these 
values is difficult. This is likely due to the lack of standardization in 
engineering assumptions, testing methodology, and reporting of the results. It 
is recommended that journals and/or experts in engineering fields conduct 
further research to investigate the feasibility of implementing reporting 
standards.

Systematic Review.","INTRODUCTION: A steadily rising opioid pandemic has left the US suffering 
significant social, economic, and health crises. Machine learning (ML) domains 
have been utilized to predict prolonged postoperative opioid (PPO) use. This 
systematic review aims to compile all up-to-date studies addressing such 
algorithms' use in clinical practice.
METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science using 
the keywords ""machine learning,"" ""opioid,"" and ""prediction."" The results were 
limited to human studies with full-text availability in English. We included all 
peer-reviewed journal articles that addressed an ML model to predict PPO use by 
adult patients.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included with a sample size ranging from 381 to 
112898, primarily orthopedic-surgery-related. Most authors define a prolonged 
misuse of opioids if it extends beyond 90 days postoperatively. Input variables 
ranged from 9 to 23 and were primarily preoperative. Most studies developed and 
tested at least two algorithms and then enhanced the best-performing model for 
use retrospectively on electronic medical records. The best-performing models 
were decision-tree-based boosting algorithms in 5 studies with AUC ranging from 
.81 to .66 and Brier scores ranging from .073 to .13, followed second by 
logistic regression classifiers in 5 studies. The topmost contributing variable 
was preoperative opioid use, followed by depression and antidepressant use, age, 
and use of instrumentation.
CONCLUSIONS: ML algorithms have demonstrated promising potential as a 
decision-supportive tool in predicting prolonged opioid use in post-surgical

metastasis. In this review, we provide an overview of recent research progress 
and new perspectives on emodin's anticancer effect. We summarize the current 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying emodin's anticancer 
activity, including its effects on signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt, 
MAPK, and NF-[Formula: see text]B pathways. We also discuss the potential of 
emodin as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment, including its use in 
combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and as a sensitizer for 
radiotherapy. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in the development of 
emodin derivatives and their potential as novel anticancer agents. Finally, we 
discuss the challenges and opportunities for the translation of emodin's 
anticancer properties into clinical applications, including the need for further 
preclinical and clinical studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In 
conclusion, emodin represents a promising natural compound with potent 
anticancer properties, and its potential as a therapeutic agent for cancer 
treatment warrants further investigation. This review provides a comprehensive 
overview of the current research progress and new perspectives on emodin's

37730648,"Intrinsic variables associated with low back pain and lumbar spine injury in 
fast bowlers in cricket: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Lumbar spine injuries in fast bowlers account for the greatest 
missed playing time in cricket. A range of extrinsic and intrinsic variables are 
hypothesised to be associated with low back pain and lumbar spine injury in fast 
bowlers, and an improved understanding of intrinsic variables is necessary as 
these may alter load tolerance and injury risk associated with fast bowling. 
This review critically evaluated studies reporting intrinsic variables 
associated with low back pain and lumbar spine injury in fast bowlers and 
identified areas for future investigation.
METHODS: OVID Medline, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS 
databases were last searched on 3 June 2022 to identify studies investigating 
intrinsic variables associated with low back pain and lumbar spine injury in 
cricket fast bowlers. Terms relevant to cricket fast bowling, and intrinsic 
variables associated with lumbar spine injury and low back pain in fast bowlers 
were searched. 1,503 abstracts were screened, and 118 full-text articles were 
appraised to determine whether they met inclusion criteria. Two authors 
independently screened search results and assessed risk of bias using a modified 
version of the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, no included 
studies demonstrated a low risk of bias, two studies were identified as moderate 
risk, and twenty-three studies were identified as high risk. Conflicting results 
were reported amongst studies investigating associations of fast bowling 
kinematics and kinetics, trunk and lumbar anatomical features, anthropometric 
traits, age, and neuromuscular characteristics with low back pain and lumbar 
spine injury.
CONCLUSION: Inconsistencies in results may be related to differences in study 
design, injury definitions, participant characteristics, measurement parameters, 
and statistical analyses. Low back pain and lumbar spine injury occurrence in 
fast bowlers remain high, and this may be due to an absence of low bias studies 
that have informed recommendations for their prevention. Future research should 
employ clearly defined injury outcomes, analyse continuous datasets, utilise 
models that better represent lumbar kinematics and kinetics during fast bowling, 
and better quantify previous injury, lumbar anatomical features and lumbar 
maturation.

carcinoma after curative resection.","PURPOSE: The prevention of recurrence for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
after curative resection is still a great challenge in clinical practice. There 
are numerous studies that trying to search for favorable strategies to decrease 
the recurrence and prolong life span for these patients, whereas no consensus is 
reached till now. Herein, we aim to compare the efficacy between different 
reported treatments by network meta-analysis(NMA).
METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for abstracts 
and full-text articles published from database inception through February 2023. 
All of the random controlled trials(RCTs) were evaluated and collected as 
eligible studies. The primary outcome was the prevention of recurrence between 
different procedures. The second outcomes were one-year survival, three-year 
survival and five-year survival.
RESULTS: Thirty-two RCTs including 5783 patients were selected, and 12 
treatments were classified. Most of the studies were high quality with low bias. 
Thirty-one studies including 5629 patients were recruited for recurrence 
analysis. The network meta-analysis showed benefits from transarterial 
chemoembolization(TACE) + portal vein chemotherapy(PVC)[OR, 2.84 (1.15,6.99)] 
and internal radiotherapy(IRT) [OR, 2.63 (1.41,4.91)] compared to 
non-adjuvant(NA) treatment when considering prevention of recurrence. Seventeen 
studies including 2047 patients were collected for one-year survival analysis. 
The network meta-analysis showed benefit from TACE[OR, 0.33 (0.14,0.75)] when 
considering one-year survival. Twenty-one studies including 2463 patients were 
collected for three-year survival analysis. The network meta-analysis showed 
TACE [OR, 0.51 (0.30,0.86)], IRT[OR, 0.41 (0.20,0.83)] and dendritic cell(DC) 
[OR, 0.09 (0.01,0.98)] were better than NA when considering three-year survival. 
Sixteen studies including 1915 patients were collected for five-year survival 
analysis. The network meta-analysis didn't show any benefit from different 
treatments when considering five-year survival. Other strategies including 
external radiotherapy(ERT), branched-chain amino acids(BCAA), hepatic artery

protocol.","INTRODUCTION: Aedes mosquitoes are the primary vectors for the spread of viruses 
like dengue (DENV), zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV), all of which affect 
humans. Those diseases contribute to global public health issues because of 
their great dispersion in rural and urban areas. Mathematical and statistical 
models have become helpful in understanding these diseases' epidemiological 
dynamics. However, modelling the complexity of a real phenomenon, such as a 
viral disease, should consider several factors. This scoping review aims to 
document, identify and classify the most important factors as well as the 
modelling strategies for the spread of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct searches in electronic bibliographic 
databases such as PubMed, MathSciNet and the Web of Science for full-text 
peer-reviewed articles written in English, French and Spanish. These articles 
should use mathematical and statistical modelling frameworks to study dengue, 
zika and chikungunya, and their cocirculation/coinfection with other diseases, 
with a publication date between 1 January 2011 and 31 July 2023. Eligible 
studies should employ deterministic, stochastic or statistical modelling 
approaches, consider control measures and incorporate parameters' estimation or 
considering calibration/validation approaches. We will exclude articles focusing 
on clinical/laboratory experiments or theoretical articles that do not include 
any case study. Two reviewers specialised in zoonotic diseases and 
mathematical/statistical modelling will independently screen and retain relevant 
studies. Data extraction will be performed using a structured form, and the 
findings of the study will be summarised through classification and descriptive 
analysis. Three scoping reviews will be published, each focusing on one disease 
and its cocirculation/co-infection with other diseases.

37730391,Incidence of vasa praevia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To derive accurate estimates of the incidence of vasa praevia (VP) 
in a routine population of unselected pregnancies.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane database was 
performed to review relevant citations reporting outcomes in pregnancies with VP 
from January 2000 until 5 April 2023.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STUDIES: Prospective or retrospective 
cohort or population studies that provided data regarding VP cases in routine 
unselected pregnancies during the study period. We included studies published in 
the English language after the year 2000 to reflect contemporary obstetric and 
neonatal practice.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened the 
retrieved citations and extracted data. The methodological quality of studies 
was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses was used to ensure standardised reporting 
of studies.
RESULTS: A total of 3847 citations were screened and 82 full-text manuscripts 
were retrieved for analysis. There were 24 studies that met the inclusion 
criteria, of which 12 studies reported prenatal diagnosis with a systematic 
protocol of screening. There were 1320 pregnancies with VP in a total population 
of 2 278 561 pregnancies; the weighted pooled incidence of VP was 0.79 (95% CI: 
0.59 to 1.01) per 1000 pregnancies, corresponding to 1 case of VP per 1271 (95% 
CI: 990 to 1692) pregnancies. Nested subanalysis of studies reporting screening 
for VP based on a specific protocol identified 395 pregnancies with VP in a 
population of 732 654 pregnancies with weighted pooled incidence of 0.82 (95% 
CI: 0.53 to 1.18) per 1000 pregnancies (1 case of VP per 1218 (95% CI: 847 to 
1901) pregnancies).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of VP in unselected pregnancies is 1 in 1218 
pregnancies. This is higher than is previously reported and can be used as a 
basis to assess whether screening for this condition should be part of routine 
clinical practice. Incorporation of strategies to screen for VP in routine

37730384,Young people's opinions of cancer care in England: the BRIGHTLIGHT cohort.,"OBJECTIVES: The BRIGHTLIGHT cohort study was the national evaluation of cancer 
services for teenager and young adults (TYA). This was analysis of free-text 
survey data to better understand their experiences of cancer care.
DESIGN: Cohort study SETTING: National Health Service hospitals delivering 
cancer care in England PARTICIPANTS: 830 young people newly diagnosed with 
cancer.
INTERVENTIONS: Exposure to specialist care in the first 6 months after diagnosis 
defined as care in a TYA Principal Treatment Centre (PTC). This was categorised 
as follows: all care in a TYA-PTC (ALL-TYA-PTC), no care in a TYA-PTC 
(NO-TYA-PTC) so care delivered in a children/adult unit only and some care in a 
TYA-PTC with additional care in a children's/adult unit (SOME-TYA-PTC).
PRIMARY OUTCOME: Data were collected through the BRIGHTLIGHT survey included 
free-text questions which asked patients 'what was the best aspects of their 
experiences of care' and 'what aspects could be improved'. These comments were 
analysed using content analysis. Themes were compared between categories of 
care, then ranked in order of frequency, ranging from the most endorsed to the 
least.
RESULTS: Overall, young people were most positive about their healthcare team, 
while the area highlighted for improvement was diagnostic experience. 
Differences between the three groups suggested those who had some or all 
treatment in a TYA-PTC valued the place of care. Regardless of where TYA were 
treated their healthcare teams were favourably viewed. Age appropriate place of 
care was highlighted to be of value for those in PTCs.
CONCLUSIONS: These data show the value young people placed on the care they 
received in TYA specific wards. Young people who accessed some or all of their 
care in a TYA-PTC highly endorsed their place of care as one of the best 
elements of their care, and it is further emphasised by those who had shared 
care who experienced difficulty with lack of age-appropriate care when treated

37729838,"Contrastive diagnostic embedding (CDE) model for automated coding - A case study 
using emergency department encounters.","BACKGROUND: Billing codes are utilized for medical reimbursement, clinical 
quality metric valuation and for epidemiologic purposes to report and follow 
disease trends and outcomes. The current paradigm of manual coding can be 
expensive, time-consuming, and subject to human error. Though automation of the 
billing codes has been widely reported in the literature via rule-based and 
supervised approaches, existing strategies lack generalizability and robustness 
towards large and constantly changing ICD hierarchical structure.
METHOD: We propose a weakly supervised training strategy by leveraging 
contrastive learning, contrastive diagnosis embedding (CDE) to capture the fine 
semantic variations between the diagnosis codes. The approach consists of a 
two-phase contrastive training for generating the semantic embedding space 
adapted to incorporate hierarchical information of ICD-10 vocabulary and a 
weakly supervised retrieval scheme. Core strength of the proposed method is that 
it puts no limit on the 70 K ICD-10 codes set and can handle all rare codes for 
coding the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Our CDE model outperformed string-based partial matching and 
ClinicalBERT embedding on three test cases (a retrospective testset, a 
prospective testset, and external testset) and produced an accurate prediction 
of rare and newly introduced diagnosis codes. A detailed ablation study showed 
the importance of each phase of the proposed multi-phase training. Each 
successive phase of training - ICD-10 group sensitive training (phase 1.1), 
ICD-10 subgroup sensitive training (phase 1.2), free-text diagnosis 
description-based training (phase 2) - improved performance beyond the previous 
phase of training. The model also outperformed existing supervised models like 
CAML and PLM-ICD and produced satisfactory performance on the rare codes.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the existing rule-based and supervised models, the 
proposed weakly supervised contrastive learning overcomes the limitations in 
terms of generalization capability and increases the robustness of the automated 
billing. Such a model will allow flexibility through accurate billing code 
automation for practice convergence and gains efficiencies in a value-based care 
payment environment.","The current paradigm of manual coding can be expensive, time-consuming, and subject to human error.

Vignette Study.","BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, a linguistic artificial intelligence (AI) model engineered 
by OpenAI, offers prospective contributions to mental health professionals. 
Although having significant theoretical implications, ChatGPT's practical 
capabilities, particularly regarding suicide prevention, have not yet been 
substantiated.
OBJECTIVE: The study's aim was to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to assess suicide 
risk, taking into consideration 2 discernable factors-perceived burdensomeness 
and thwarted belongingness-over a 2-month period. In addition, we evaluated 
whether ChatGPT-4 more accurately evaluated suicide risk than did ChatGPT-3.5.
METHODS: ChatGPT was tasked with assessing a vignette that depicted a 
hypothetical patient exhibiting differing degrees of perceived burdensomeness 
and thwarted belongingness. The assessments generated by ChatGPT were 
subsequently contrasted with standard evaluations rendered by mental health 
professionals. Using both ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 (May 24, 2023), we executed 
3 evaluative procedures in June and July 2023. Our intent was to scrutinize 
ChatGPT-4's proficiency in assessing various facets of suicide risk in relation 
to the evaluative abilities of both mental health professionals and an earlier 
version of ChatGPT-3.5 (March 14 version).
RESULTS: During the period of June and July 2023, we found that the likelihood 
of suicide attempts as evaluated by ChatGPT-4 was similar to the norms of mental 
health professionals (n=379) under all conditions (average Z score of 0.01). 
Nonetheless, a pronounced discrepancy was observed regarding the assessments 
performed by ChatGPT-3.5 (May version), which markedly underestimated the 
potential for suicide attempts, in comparison to the assessments carried out by 
the mental health professionals (average Z score of -0.83). The empirical 
evidence suggests that ChatGPT-4's evaluation of the incidence of suicidal 
ideation and psychache was higher than that of the mental health professionals 
(average Z score of 0.47 and 1.00, respectively). Conversely, the level of 
resilience as assessed by both ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 (both versions) was 
observed to be lower in comparison to the assessments offered by mental health 
professionals (average Z score of -0.89 and -0.90, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ChatGPT-4 estimates the likelihood of 
suicide attempts in a manner akin to evaluations provided by professionals. In 
terms of recognizing suicidal ideation, ChatGPT-4 appears to be more precise. 
However, regarding psychache, there was an observed overestimation by ChatGPT-4, 
indicating a need for further research. These results have implications 
regarding ChatGPT-4's potential to support gatekeepers, patients, and even 
mental health professionals' decision-making. Despite the clinical potential, 
intensive follow-up studies are necessary to establish the use of ChatGPT-4's 
capabilities in clinical practice. The finding that ChatGPT-3.5 frequently 
underestimates suicide risk, especially in severe cases, is particularly

Identified by a Combination of Text Mining and RNA Sequencing.","INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is a well-known malignant tumor that causes 
millions of deaths worldwide every year. Due to the lack of a specific biomarker 
for gastric cancer, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the 
disease which results in a poor prognosis and a higher death rate. Therefore, 
novel biomarkers are urgently needed for early diagnosis and to improve the 
survival rate.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted RNA sequencing of tumor samples from 21 
patients with gastric cancer. A total of 3192 differentially expressed genes 
(1589 up-regulated and 1603 down-regulated) were identified. Subsequently, we 
applied a text-mining algorithm for further analysis of these data and selected 
30 representative genes to investigate as candidates for novel biomarkers in 
gastric cancer.
RESULTS: Among these genes, we confirmed transient receptor potential melastatin 
8 channels (TRPM8) as a novel biomarker based on Western blot and 
immunochemistry validation performed on 134 samples. Compared to normal gastric 
tissue, the tumor tissues exhibited a significantly higher expression level of

foot ulcers: a scoping review.","BACKGROUND: The availability and effectiveness of Digital Health Technologies 
(DHTs) to support clinicians, empower patients, and generate economic savings 
for national healthcare systems are growing rapidly. Of particular promise is 
the capacity of DHTs to autonomously facilitate remote monitoring and treatment. 
Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are characterised by high rates of infection, 
amputation, mortality, and healthcare costs. With clinical outcomes contingent 
on activities that can be readily monitored, DFUs present a promising focus for 
the application of remote DHTs.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review has been conducted as a first step toward 
ascertaining fthe data-related challenges and opportunities for the development 
of more comprehensive, integrated, and individualised sense/act DHTs. We review 
the latest developments in the application of DHTs to the remote care of DFUs. 
We cover the types of DHTs in development and their features, technological 
readiness, and scope of clinical testing.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only peer-reviewed original experimental and observational 
studies, case series and qualitative studies were included in literature 
searches. All reviews and manuscripts presenting pre-trial prototype 
technologies were excluded.
METHODS: An initial search of three databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, and 
Scopus) generated 1,925 English-language papers for screening. 388 papers were 
assessed as eligible for full-text screening by the review team. 81 manuscripts 
were found to meet the eligibility criteria.
RESULTS: Only 19% of studies incorporated multiple DHTs. We categorised 56% of 
studies as 'Treatment-Manual', i.e. studies involving technologies aimed at 
treatment requiring manual data generation, and 26% as 'Prevention-Autonomous', 
i.e. studies of technologies generating data autonomously through wearable 
sensors aimed at ulcer prevention through patient behavioural change. Only 10% 
of studies involved more ambitious 'Treatment-Autonomous' interventions. We 
found that studies generally reported high levels of patient adherence and 
satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a major potential role for DHTs in remote 
personalised medical management of DFUs. However, larger studies are required to 
assess their impact. Here, we see opportunities for developing much larger, more

characterization, antimetabolic syndrome, and other potential applications.","Brown seaweeds are a promising source of bioactive substances, particularly 
oligosaccharides. This group has recently gained considerable attention due to 
its diverse cell wall composition, structure, and wide-spectrum bioactivities. 
This review article provides a comprehensive update on advances in 
oligosaccharides (OSs) production from brown seaweeds and their potential health 
applications. It focuses on advances in feedstock pretreatment, extraction, 
characterization, and purification prior to OS use for potential health 
applications. Brown seaweed oligosaccharides (BSOSs) are extracted using various 
methods. Among these, enzymatic hydrolysis is the most preferred, with high 
specificity, mild reaction conditions, and low energy consumption. However, the 
enzyme selection and hydrolysis conditions need to be optimized for desirable 
yield and oligosaccharides composition. Characterization of oligosaccharides is 
essential to determine their structure and properties related to bioactivities 
and to predict their most suitable application. This is well covered in this 
review. Analytical techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography

37726791,"Prevalence and quality of temporomandibular disorders, chronic pain and 
psychological distress in patients with classical and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome: an exploratory study.","BACKGROUND: The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of clinically and 
genetically heterogeneous hereditary diseases affecting the connective tissue. 
They are characterized by hypermobility of the joints, hyperextensible skin and 
friable tissue. According to current classification, 13 subtypes can be 
distinguished, of which the hypermobile and the classical subtype are the most 
prevalent. This study aimed to evaluate patients with classical (cEDS) and 
hypermobile (hEDS) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome regarding temporomandibular disorder 
(TMD), chronic pain, and psychological distress.
METHODS: Support groups from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland were contacted, 
and social media were used to recruit participants. Free text questions, the 
German version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), and the German 
version of the Graded Chronic Pain Status (GCPS) were used.
RESULTS: 259 participants were included (230 hEDS/29 cEDS). At least 49.2% of 
the participants had painful or restricted jaw movements, and at least 84.9% had 
pain in the masticatory muscles, with 46.3% already having a diagnosed TMD. 
Multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between TMJ involvement 
and chronic pain with a 2.5-fold higher risk of chronic pain with a diagnosed 
TMD. 22.8% of participants had a critical score for depression, 53.3% had a 
critical score for anxiety, and 34.0% had a critical score for stress.
CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of TMD problems and chronic pain in 
patients with cEDS and hEDS. The lack of knowledge about these problems can 
create psychological distress. More research is needed to provide adequate 
treatment for patients with EDS.","Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous hereditary diseases affecting the connective tissue.

37726485,"Natural language processing for automatic evaluation of free-text answers - a 
feasibility study based on the European Diploma in Radiology examination.","BACKGROUND: Written medical examinations consist of multiple-choice questions 
and/or free-text answers. The latter require manual evaluation and rating, which 
is time-consuming and potentially error-prone. We tested whether natural 
language processing (NLP) can be used to automatically analyze free-text answers 
to support the review process.
METHODS: The European Board of Radiology of the European Society of Radiology 
provided representative datasets comprising sample questions, answer keys, 
participant answers, and reviewer markings from European Diploma in Radiology 
examinations. Three free-text questions with the highest number of corresponding 
answers were selected: Questions 1 and 2 were ""unstructured"" and required a 
typical free-text answer whereas question 3 was ""structured"" and offered a 
selection of predefined wordings/phrases for participants to use in their 
free-text answer. The NLP engine was designed using word lists, rule-based 
synonyms, and decision tree learning based on the answer keys and its 
performance tested against the gold standard of reviewer markings.
RESULTS: After implementing the NLP approach in Python, F1 scores were 
calculated as a measure of NLP performance: 0.26 (unstructured question 1, n = 
96), 0.33 (unstructured question 2, n = 327), and 0.5 (more structured question, 
n = 111). The respective precision/recall values were 0.26/0.27, 0.4/0.32, and 
0.62/0.55.
CONCLUSION: This study showed the successful design of an NLP-based approach for 
automatic evaluation of free-text answers in the EDiR examination. Thus, as a 
future field of application, NLP could work as a decision-support system for 
reviewers and support the design of examinations being adjusted to the 
requirements of an automated, NLP-based review process.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Natural language processing can be successfully 
used to automatically evaluate free-text answers, performing better with more 
structured question-answer formats. Furthermore, this study provides a baseline 
for further work applying, e.g., more elaborated NLP approaches/large language 
models.

37726022,"Medication Reconciliation During Transitions of Care Across Institutions: A 
quantitative analysis of challenges and opportunities.","OBJECTIVE: Medication discrepancies between clinical systems may pose a patient 
safety hazard. In this paper, we identify challenges and quantify medication 
discrepancies across transitions of care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used structured clinical data and free-text hospital 
discharge summaries to compare active medications lists at four time points: 
pre-admission (outpatient), at-admission (inpatient), at-discharge (inpatient) 
and post-discharge (outpatient). Medication lists were normalized to RxNorm. 
RxNorm identifiers were further processed using the RxNav API to identify the 
ingredient. The specific drugs and ingredients from inpatient and outpatient 
medication lists were compared.
RESULTS: Using RxNorm drugs, the median percentage intersection when comparing 
active medication lists within the same EHR system ranged between 94.1% and 100% 
indicating substantial overlap. Similarly, when using RxNorm ingredients the 
median percentage intersection was 94.1% to 100%. In contrast, the median 
percentage intersection when comparing active medication lists across EHR 
systems was significantly lower (RxNorm drugs: 6.1-7.1%; RxNorm ingredients: 
29.4-35.0%) indicating that the active medication lists were significantly less 
similar (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Medication lists in the same EHR system are more similar to each 
other (fewer discrepancies) than medication lists in different EHR systems when 
comparing specific RxNorm drug and the more general RxNorm ingredients at 
transitions of care. Transitions of care that require interoperability between 
two EHR systems are associated with more discrepancies than transitions where 
medication changes are expected (e.g., at-admission vs at-discharge). Challenges 
included lack of access to structured, standardized medication data across 
systems and difficulty distinguishing medications from orderable supplies such 
as lancets and diabetic test strips.

opportunities to identify and assist with medication reconciliation across 
transitions of care between institutions.","Medication discrepancies between clinical systems may pose a patient safety hazard.

using continued pretraining.","OBJECTIVE: The classification of clinical note sections is a critical step 
before doing more fine-grained natural language processing tasks such as social 
determinants of health extraction and temporal information extraction. Often, 
clinical note section classification models that achieve high accuracy for 1 
institution experience a large drop of accuracy when transferred to another 
institution. The objective of this study is to develop methods that classify 
clinical note sections under the SOAP (""Subjective,"" ""Object,"" ""Assessment,"" and 
""Plan"") framework with improved transferability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained the baseline models by fine-tuning BERT-based 
models, and enhanced their transferability with continued pretraining, including 
domain-adaptive pretraining and task-adaptive pretraining. We added in-domain 
annotated samples during fine-tuning and observed model performance over a 
varying number of annotated sample size. Finally, we quantified the impact of 
continued pretraining in equivalence of the number of in-domain annotated 
samples added.
RESULTS: We found continued pretraining improved models only when combined with 
in-domain annotated samples, improving the F1 score from 0.756 to 0.808, 
averaged across 3 datasets. This improvement was equivalent to adding 35 
in-domain annotated samples.
DISCUSSION: Although considered a straightforward task when performing 
in-domain, section classification is still a considerably difficult task when 
performing cross-domain, even using highly sophisticated neural network-based 
methods.

potentials in tetralogy of Fallot.","BACKGROUND: Arrhythmias may originate from surgically unaffected right 
ventricular (RV) regions in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). We aimed to 
investigate action potential (AP) remodelling and arrhythmia susceptibility in 
RV myocardium of patients with repaired and with unrepaired TOF, identify 
possible correlations with clinical phenotype and myocardial fibrosis, and 
compare findings with data from patients with atrial septal defect (ASD), a less 
severe congenital heart disease.
METHODS: Intracellular AP were recorded ex vivo in RV outflow tract samples from 
22 TOF and three ASD patients. Arrhythmias were provoked by superfusion with 
solutions containing reduced potassium and barium chloride, or isoprenaline. 
Myocardial fibrosis was quantified histologically and associations between 
clinical phenotype, AP shape, tissue arrhythmia propensity, and fibrosis were 
examined.
RESULTS: Electrophysiological abnormalities (arrhythmias, AP duration [APD] 
alternans, impaired APD shortening at increased stimulation frequencies) were 
generally present in TOF tissue, even from infants, but rare or absent in ASD 
samples. More severely diseased and acyanotic patients, pronounced tissue 
susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis, and greater fibrosis extent were associated 
with longer APD. In contrast, APD was shorter in tissue from patients with 
pre-operative cyanosis. Increased fibrosis and repaired-TOF status were linked 
to tissue arrhythmia inducibility.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional and structural tissue remodelling may explain arrhythmic 
activity in TOF patients, even at a very young age. Surprisingly, clinical 
acyanosis appears to be associated with more severe arrhythmogenic remodelling.

cancer by using user-defined prompts. Materials and Methods This retrospective 
study included patients who underwent lung cancer follow-up CT between September 
2021 and March 2023. A subset of 25 reports was reserved for prompt engineering 
to instruct the LLMs in extracting lesion diameters, labeling metastatic 
disease, and assessing oncologic progression. This output was fed into a

(CPOE): mapping the data to FHIR.","OBJECTIVE: Medication errors are the third leading cause of death. There are 
several methods to prevent prescription errors, one of which is to use a 
Computerized Physician Order Entry system (CPOE). In a CPOE system, necessary 
data needs to be collected so that making decisions about prescribing 
medications and treatment plans could be made. Although many CPOE systems have 
been developed worldwide, studies have yet to identify the necessary data and 
data elements of CPOE systems. This study aims to identify data elements of CPOE 
and standardize these data with Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources 
(FHIR) to facilitate data sharing and integration with the electronic health 
record (EHR) system and reduce data diversity.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases for studies up to 
October 2019 were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed original 
articles to determine eligibility for inclusion in this review. All articles 
describing data elements of a COPE system were included. Data elements were 
obtained from the included articles' text, tables, and figures.Classification of 
the extracted data elements and mapping them to FHIR was done to facilitate data 
sharing and integration with the electronic health record (EHR) system and 
reduce data diversity. The final data elements of CPOE were categorized into 
five main categories of FHIR (foundation, base, clinical, financial, and 
specialized) and 146 resources, where possible. One of the researchers did 
mapping and checked and verified by the second researcher. If a data element 
could not be mapped to any FHIR resources, this data element was considered an 
extension to the most relevant resource.
RESULTS: We retrieved 5162 articles through database searches. After the 
full-text assessment, 21 articles were included. In total, 270 data elements 
were identified and mapped to the FHIR standard. These elements have been 
reported in 26 FHIR resources of 146 ones (18%). In total, 71 data elements were 
considered an extension.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the same data elements were 
not used in the CPOE systems, and the degree of homogeneity of these systems is 
limited. The mapping of extracted data with data elements used in the FHIR 
standard shows the extent to which these systems comply with existing standards.

37723589,"Effectiveness of de-implementation strategies for low-value prescribing in 
secondary care: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Considerable efforts have been made to improve guideline 
adherence in healthcare through de-implementation, such as decreasing the 
prescription of inappropriate medicines. However, we have limited knowledge 
about the effectiveness, barriers, facilitators and consequences of 
de-implementation strategies targeting inappropriate medication prescribing in 
secondary care settings. This review was conducted to understand these factors 
to contribute to better replication and optimisation of future de-implementation 
efforts to reduce low-value care.
METHODS: A systematic review of randomised control trials was conducted. Papers 
were identified through CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane register of 
controlled trials to February 2021. Eligible studies were randomised control 
trials evaluating behavioural strategies to de-implement inappropriate 
prescribing in secondary healthcare. Risk of bias was assessed using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Intervention characteristics, effectiveness, 
barriers, facilitators and consequences were identified in the study text and 
tabulated.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, of which seven were reported as 
effectively de-implementing low-value prescribing. Included studies were judged 
to be mainly at low to moderate risk for selection biases and generally high 
risk for performance and reporting biases. The majority of these strategies were 
clinical decision support at the 'point of care'. Clinical decision support 
tools were the most common and effective. They were found to be a low-cost and 
simple strategy. However, barriers such as clinician's reluctance to accept 
recommendations, or the clinical setting were potential barriers to their 
success. Educational strategies were the second most reported intervention type 
however the utility of educational strategies for de-implementation remains 
varied. Multiple barriers and facilitators relating to the environmental 
context, resources and knowledge were identified across studies as potentially 
influencing de-implementation. Various consequences were identified; however, 
few measured the impact of de-implementation on usual appropriate practice.
CONCLUSION: This review offers insight into the intervention strategies, 
potential barriers, facilitators and consequences that may affect the 
de-implementation of low-value prescribing in secondary care. Identification of 
these key features helps understand how and why these strategies are effective 
and the wider (desirable or undesirable) impact of de-implementation. These 
findings can contribute to the successful replication or optimisation of 
strategies used to de-implement low-value prescribing practices in future.

The majority of these strategies were clinical decision support at the 'point of care' Educational strategies were the second most reported intervention type. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Intervention characteristics, effectiveness, barriers, facilitators and consequences were identified in the study text and tabulated. Identification of these key features helps understand how and why these strategies are effective.",0.902840078,0.764279485,0.839939654,0.136465324,0.157303371,0.837016575
37723447,"Lower limb muscle strength and balance in older adults with a distal radius 
fracture: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Distal radius fractures are common fractures in older adults and 
associated with increased risk of future functional decline and hip fracture. 
Whether lower limb muscle strength and balance are impaired in this patient 
population is uncertain. To help inform rehabilitation requirements, this 
systematic review aimed to compare lower limb muscle strength and balance 
between older adults with a distal radius fracture with matched controls, and to 
synthesise lower limb muscle strength and balance outcomes in older adults with 
a distal radius fracture.
METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and CINAHL (1990 to 25 May 2022) for 
randomised and non-randomised controlled clinical trials and observational 
studies that measured lower limb muscle strength and/or balance using 
instrumented measurements or validated tests, in adults aged ≥ 50 years enrolled 
within one year after distal radius fracture. We appraised included 
observational studies using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and included 
randomised controlled trials using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Due to the 
clinical and methodological heterogeneity in included studies, we synthesised 
results narratively in tables and text.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies (10 case-control studies, five case series, and four 
randomised controlled trials) of variable methodological quality and including 
1835 participants (96% women, mean age 55-73 years, median sample size 82) were 
included. Twelve included studies (63%) assessed strength using 10 different 
methods with knee extension strength most commonly assessed (6/12 (50%) 
studies). Five included case-control studies (50%) assessed lower limb strength. 
Cases demonstrated impaired strength during functional tests (two studies), but 
knee extension strength assessment findings were conflicting (three studies). 
Eighteen included studies (95%) assessed balance using 14 different methods. 
Single leg balance was most commonly assessed (6/18 (33%) studies). All 
case-control studies assessed balance with inconsistent findings.
CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, there is some evidence that older adults with 
a distal radius fracture have impaired lower limb muscle strength and balance. A 
cautious interpretation is required due to inconsistent findings across studies 
and/or outcome measures. Heterogeneity in control participants' characteristics, 
study design, study quality, and assessment methods limited synthesis of 
results. Robust case-control and/or prospective observational studies are 
needed.
